# Brazen

Brazen is a simple project framework that includes gulp and some basic sass/css including the bootstrap grid.

Brazen is current in very early development and is built to my mindset for when I build personal projects.

An overview of the components and the initial styling can be found at http://ssddanbrown.github.io/Brazen.
